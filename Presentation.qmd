We invite all SoG postgraduates the opportunity to present some research. This could be an aspect of your PhD thesis, or a research project/paper that you have contributed to. It is expected that presentations are most suited to **3rd year PhD students**, however are open to all. Presentations should be **10 minutes**, followed by **5 minutes** of Q/A.

In order to present, please submit an abstract of your research (around 300 words) by the **13th of October** using this form ([here](https://forms.office.com/e/b5dEUFB143)). This is to help position your presentation within the appropriate thematic session. This should not be an exhaustive task, all is required is a brief summary of the research you want to present.

#### Guidelines for Presenting

-   The presentation must be 10 minutes, so please keep to the timings. It will be great practice for future conferences that might be a bit more strict!
-   Audience will have the opportunity to ask questions to the presenter for 5 minutes, directly after the presentation.
-   The session chair will help manage time, notifying when there are a few minutes left and coordinating the following Q/A.
-   **Presenting in-person:** The PowerPoint presentation must emailed to gy17pls\@leeds.ac.uk by the **31st October**
-   **Presenting online:** Ensure you have entered the Teams session using the links provided (will be uploaded on website & sent via email) and that your camera and microphone are working correctly.
