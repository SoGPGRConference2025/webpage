title: "Lightning Talk"
---

We invite all first-year PGRs an opportunity to present a lightning talk (2-3 mins). This could be a brief introduction to yourself or some initial research ideas! The floor is yours, and it's a great opportunity to introduce yourself to your peers in a fun, relaxed setting! Presentations should be **2-3 minutes**!

In order to present, please fill out this form ([here](https://forms.office.com/e/b5dEUFB143)). If you would like to use some slides or a visual background (this is optional), email the materials to gy17pls\@leeds.ac.uk by 31st October 2025.
